This repo is primarily a portfolio demo. If you want to extend it:

- Add items in `Items_DB` (unique Code)
- Add assembly rows in `Assemblies_DB` with sequential `Seq` starting at 1
- Keep the `Key` format: `Assembly_Code|01`

Suggested improvements:
- Add an "Actual Costs" sheet and variance reporting
- Add a printable estimate summary page
- Add category rollups (by Category or Project_Type)
